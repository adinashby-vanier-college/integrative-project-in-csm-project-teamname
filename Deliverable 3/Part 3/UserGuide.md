# The Unknown Variable

## Getting Started

To play the game, first open the project in IntelliJ IDEA. After opening the folder, find the main class and
run it. The game will start with a login and sign-up screen. Here, you can either log into an existing
account or create a new one.

## Story Introduction

After logging in or signing up, you’ll see a short dialogue (story). This part introduces the mystery and
helps you understand what the game is about. It sets up the background for the case you need to solve.

## Home Page Overview

Next, you’ll go to the home page. This is where you can choose what to do next. You’ll see three main
buttons:

```
 Play – takes you to the game area
 Suspects – shows a list of people involved
in the mystery
 Quit – closes the game
```

There’s also a locked case file on this screen. You won’t be able to click it until you finish all four games.

## Main Game Hub

Clicking the Play button brings you to the main game area. Here, you can choose from four different
science and math-based games. Before each game starts, you’ll see an instruction screen that explains
how to play.

In every game, there’s a Clue or Theory button at the bottom right.


Clicking it shows hints or formulas to help you solve the challenge.

You’ll also see a Home button at the bottom right,

which takes you back to the home page.


## Suspect Scene

Clicking the Suspects button on the home page takes you to a page with pictures and names of all the
suspects.

Click on a suspect to see more details like their height, if they wear glasses, their occupation, and eye
color. These clues are important for figuring out who the real culprit is.

## Unlocking the Final Clue

Once you finish all four games, the locked case file on the home page will unlock. You can now click it to go
to the final scene.

This final scene looks like the suspect page, but now if you click on a suspect, you’re officially accusing
them.

Use all the clues you’ve gathered to choose the correct person and solve the mystery!
